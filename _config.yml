  I am a data scientist with an electrical/product engineering background and 2+ years of experience in programming and data analysis. 
  With a passion for machine learning, I am eager to gain and use data-driven insights, present deliverables, and collaborate effectively both in-person and remotely.
  My projects include a minimum viable product for Airbnb review sentiment classification which you can try out at this link: tinyurl.com/rating-predictor 
  Looking forward to connecting with you!

  I am continuously learning and added new projects, stay tuned! :)
